# HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS

## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare operational, patient, doctor, appointment, treatment, and revenue data using SQL for data preparation and analysis and Power BI for interactive dashboards.
The goal is to derive actionable insights that support hospital management in decision-making, resource planning, and performance monitoring.

## 🎯 OBJECTIVES
   - ANALYZE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS AND VISIT BEHAVIOR
   - TRACK APPOINTMENT TRENDS AND COMPLETION RATES
   - EVALUATE DOCTOR AND DEPARTMENT PERFORMANCE
   - UNDERSTAND TREATMENT AND DIAGNOSIS PATTERNS
   - MEASURE REVENUE, BILLING, AND FINANCIAL KPIs

## 🗂️ DATASETS USED
The project uses multiple related tables to enable relational analysis:
   - <a href="https://github.com/Saranes55/SQL-PowerBI_Project/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analysis/Datasets/Patients.csv">**PATIENTS**</a> – Patient demographics (Age, Gender, City)
   - <a href="https://github.com/Saranes55/SQL-PowerBI_Project/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analysis/Datasets/Doctors.csv">**DOCTORS**</a> – Doctor details and departments
   - <a href="https://github.com/Saranes55/SQL-PowerBI_Project/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analysis/Datasets/Appointments.csv">**APPOINTMENTS**</a> – Appointment dates, status, doctor & patient mapping
   - <a href="https://github.com/Saranes55/SQL-PowerBI_Project/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analysis/Datasets/Treatment.csv">**TREATMENTS**</a> – Diagnosis and treatment information
   - <a href="https://github.com/Saranes55/SQL-PowerBI_Project/blob/main/Healthcare%20Analysis/Datasets/Billing.csv">**BILLING**</a> – Treatment cost, revenue, and payment status

## 🧹 DATA CLEANING & PREPARATION (SQL)
Key data preparation steps performed using SQL:
   - NULL VALUE CHECKS AND REMOVAL
   - INVALID AGE AND DATE VALIDATION
   - DUPLICATE RECORD IDENTIFICATION
   - STANDARDIZATION OF COLUMNS (STATUS, GENDER, CITY)
   - DATA TYPE CORRECTIONS
   - RELATIONAL JOINS BETWEEN TABLE
